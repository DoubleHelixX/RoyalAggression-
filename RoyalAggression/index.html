<p> Hello and welcome to Royal Aggression.com; as you can already notice, i love fighting games. Ever since i was a kid i always had an interest and a admiration to fighting games like street fighter, tekken, power stone, and bloody raw. I remember watching my uncle play killer instinct for the super nintendo and all i wanted to do was press buttons and hopefully guess right so that my character performed a combo haha. My love for fighting games grew even more in 2008 when street fighter 4 for the xbox 360 launched. It was the first time i took a game that seriously and even made friends who shared the same passion but as soon as i knew it, my competitive nature soon took over. Just simply playing it wasn't enough, i had to win. In order to do that i had to practice, playing people who were better then me and learning from my loses. I had to learn combos and do my research. my passion only grew as i became more involved and i soon started venturing out to other fighting games like MvC3, skullgirls, tekken 5, 3rd strike and ect. I even showed up at some tournaments at Next Level either to enter or to be a spectator. So thats a little bit about my past and insight to how my passion for fighting games came into existence but who am I and why did i make this site? For starters my name is Tommy Rivera and i am a college student. My major is CIS so naturally coding becomes something i don't mind to do; in fact i love it. This website was created for an (mmp)  multimedia design class project. I was to design a website with a topic of choice and i was confident in my knowledge in html now to create a website driven from my passion of fighting games.  <hr style="margin: 1em 0" /> </p>  <P> <italic> SO WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE ABOUT ? </italic> <br><br>  Well i would say its mostly a fan service to the fighting game community and really to anyone who has any kind of admiration and respect for the art of fighting games. The website is focused mainly on the FGC and to a few chosen fighting games. It will contain an art galley to view various artwork related to fighting games ; fan art included. It contains the biography of beloved characters from various fighting games and as well as video gameplay, tournament footage and tutorials. Music and more information is also included.  The goals of my website is to spread awareness of fighting games to new comers so that the FGC can continue to grow and get recognition. I will gather and supply the FGC will important information regarding fighting games. I hope you enjoy the site and if you wish to contact me for any questions or suggestions please feel free to ask.  My email -> tommy.rivera99@yahoo.com :) </p>
