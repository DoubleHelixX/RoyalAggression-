About: A fighting game inspired/themed website I made for a school project. The idea was to create a simple site to display html/css skills. Being that I am a huge fighting game fanatic I went alittle overboard with it and tested out alot of javascript elements.

Features: sound effects, html, javascript, css. 

Side Note: I completed this within the span of 3 days and it was my first time creating a full on site.
